What do you think are the pros and cons of manually

Why do you think some version control systems,
 like Git, allow saving multiple files in one

 each file separately?

because git is code oriented.

How can you use the commands git log and git 
diff to view the history of files?

we can see the difference between instances

confident to make changes that could break 
something?

I would be more willing to experiment

What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

it creats a .git folder with all the info needed
you need to do it to keep track of your project

How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?

it allows me to check that i am commiting the right 
things
